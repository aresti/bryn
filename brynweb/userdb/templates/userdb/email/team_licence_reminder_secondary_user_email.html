<p>Dear {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name}},</p>

<p>We are writing because you are using CLIMB-BIG-DATA as a member of '{{ team.name }}', under the responsibility of your Primary User.</p>

<p>Please remind your Primary User to renew their CLIMB-BIG-DATA licence before it expires in {{ time_remaining.days }} days ({{ team.licence_expiry }}).</p>

<p>We have already sent them an email asking to do this.</p>

<p>If we don't hear from the primary user for your group by {{ team.licence_expiry }}, all VMs associated with the group will be shelved.</p>

<p>If we then do not hear from the primary user by {{ termination_date }}, we will terminate all the VMs in the group and delete any associated volumes and data.</p>

<p>Please always remember that, by accessing our service, all users are agreeing to the current version of our terms and conditions, which are available to review at {% url "user:licence" as licence_url %}{{ licence_url|absolute_url|urlize }}</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>
